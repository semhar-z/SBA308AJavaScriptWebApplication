# SBA308AJavaScriptWebApplication

// Objectives of the project are as follows:
- Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
- Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
- Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
- Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
- Organize files using modules and imports.

// I have created a simple web page that uses fetch to get random pictures of dogs

   from two different external API.

// I used async/await, modules and imports and exports using another exteranl API 

   to get other random dog pictures.

// I created user interaction with the API through a search feature

// Enable user manipulation of data within the API (I used MOCK API jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) through the use of POST
